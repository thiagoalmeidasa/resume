      \item a multi-cloud environment, orchestrated with infrastructure as a code;
    \end{tightemize}
    As an inexperienced Data Engineer, I'm working on things like:
    \begin{tightemize}
      \item provide easy access to various resources like large data sets and on-demand GPU powered machines;
      \item help reduce model results' evaluation time to a couple of minutes instead of a dozen;
      \item easy ways to monitor the results of currently deployed models;
